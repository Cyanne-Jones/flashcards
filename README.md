# FlashCards!

A fun trivia game you can play *directly from your terminal!* No PS5 needed!

This game was assigned as a Turing Mod 2 Solo Project and was written by [Cyanne Jones](https://github.com/Cyanne-Jones)


## Setup

Clone down the repo from GitHub to your local machine. Cd into the new local repo and run the console command:
```bash
node index.js
```
From there you'll be able to start playing the game! Use the arrow buttons to choose your answer and press the enter button to select it. At the end of the round, you'll get a notification that the game is complete and you'll get a percentage of answers correct!

## Technologies Used:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mocha/Chai testing
- [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Cyanne-Jones/flashcards/projects/1)

## Future Ideas

- Different question sets
- Review of incorrect answers and a prompt to retake only the questions the user answered incorrectly
- A timer to assess how long it took the user to get through the question set
